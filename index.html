        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio. Here's a little bit about me!</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Rutgers in 2020 with a degree in Information Technology and Informatics. While at Rutgers, I took several business process classes, as well as technical and development classes. I also interned at a few different places, such as PVH, where I was an automation engnieer, working on automating their change management process. Another internship was at Amazon, where I used Pythin to ETL data and standarize workstation to associate ratio, ultimately saving money for that particular warehouse. I officially started my full-time career with Maximus, where I digititized goverment services by understanding stakeholder needs and translating them into technical processes. I did the same at Weill Cornell Medicine, and am currently doing the same at Navitus Health Solutions. Not only have I been exposed to many tools and technologies. I have been exposed to working with several different teams, communicating to stakeholders, leaders, executives, and more. Please take a look at my resume to learn more.</p>
